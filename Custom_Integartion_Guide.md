To create an app for Workplace, follow the steps below:

  1. In the **Admin Panel**, open the **Integrations** tab.
  2. Click on the **Create App** button.
  3. Choose a relevent name and description forthe app.
  4. Add a profile picture for the app. This will be used any time the app is visually reresented, for instance if it makes a post to group.
  5. Choose the required permissions for the app, based on the integration functionality yourequire.
  6. Copy and safely store the access token that's shown to you. You'll need this when making API calls.
